Code Analyzer Refactoring Plan

Goal: Create a robust code analysis tool that helps developers understand and manage code complexity through clear metrics and actionable insights.

Completed Tasks:
✓ Initial project setup and structure
✓ Core analysis functionality (ComplexityAnalyzer)
✓ Basic test infrastructure
✓ ComplexityAnalyzer tests (92% coverage)
✓ Rich console output formatting
✓ ConsoleFormatter implementation and tests (100% coverage)
✓ Click-based CLI interface
✓ Directory traversal with progress bars
✓ Configuration file support (98% coverage)
✓ Output format selection

Current Status:
- Base infrastructure is solid
- Core complexity analysis is working
- Test coverage at 78% overall
- Console output is polished and informative
- CLI interface is functional and configurable

Next Tasks (in priority order):

1. Testing & Documentation
   - Add integration tests for CLI
   - Add example usage to README
   - Document configuration options
   - Add docstring coverage
   - Add type hints coverage

2. Analysis Enhancements
   - Add cognitive complexity metrics
   - Add dependency analysis
   - Add code duplication detection
   - Add historical trend analysis
   - Add file ignore patterns

3. Output Enhancements
   - Add HTML report generation
   - Add JSON output format
   - Add CSV export
   - Add trend visualization
   - Add complexity heatmaps

4. Performance Optimization
   - Add caching for analyzed files
   - Add parallel processing
   - Add incremental analysis
   - Add progress reporting
   - Add memory usage optimization

Next Action Items:
1. Create integration tests for CLI functionality
2. Add example usage and configuration documentation to README
3. Improve docstring coverage in __main__.py and base classes
4. Add missing type hints across the codebase
