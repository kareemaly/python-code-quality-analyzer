================================

This document outlines the available commands and workflow processes for development, testing, and publishing.

Development Setup
----------------
1. Create and activate virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install development dependencies:
   pip install -e ".[test]"

Available Commands

1. Run unit tests:
   ./ops/test_unit.sh

2. Run code quality checks:
   ./ops/test_quality.sh

3. Run Docker tests:
   ./ops/test_docker.sh

4. Full publication process:
   ./ops/publish.sh

Workflow Process
--------------
1. Development:
   - Make your changes
   - Run unit tests locally
   - Run code quality checks
   - Commit and push changes

2. Testing:
   - Unit tests and quality checks run automatically on each PR
   - Docker tests run after successful publication

3. Publication:
   - Merge changes to main branch
   - Run ./ops/publish.sh to:
     a. Run all tests
     b. Build and publish to PyPI
     c. Run Docker tests to verify the published package

Note: Make sure all scripts in ops/ directory are executable:
chmod +x ops/*.sh
